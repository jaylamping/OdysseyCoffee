        Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And Id like to take a minute Just sit
        right there Ill tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air In West Philadelphia born and raised
        On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin out, maxin, relaxin, all cool And all shootin some
        b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my
        neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said, Youre movin with your auntie and uncle in
        Bel-Air I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way She gave me
        a kiss and then she gave me my ticket I put my Walkman on and said, I might as well kick it First class, yo this
        is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmm, this
        might be alright But wait, I hear theyre prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just
        send this cool cat? I dont think so Ill see when I get there I hope theyre prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
        Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name
        out I aint trying to get arrested yet, I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared I
        whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said, Fresh and it had dice in the mirror If anything
        I could say that this cab was rare But I thought Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air I pulled up to the house
        about seven or eight And I yelled to the cabbie, Yo holmes, smell ya later I looked at my kingdom I was finally
        there To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
